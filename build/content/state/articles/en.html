<h1>State</h1>

<p>Let's write a simple counter, and below we will analyze it in more detail</p>

{{ counter }}

<h2>Default state</h2>

<p>
  To set the default counter state, we need to implement the constructor
  and pass the props and context arguments to the base class via the super method.
  Now you can set the initial state in this.state.
</p>

<h2>New state</h2>

<p>In the handleClick method, we set a new state through the this.setState method.</p>
<p>When you install it the following happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on the new state, a new object of the virtual DOM tree is created</li>
  <li>Then this.state merges with the new state</li>
  <li>Based on the difference between the current and the new tree, a patch tree is created</li>
  <li>Based on the patch of the tree, dom is redrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Do not modify this.state object directly, always use
  this.setState method otherwise nothing will happen.
</p>

<h2>Click handler</h2>
<p>
  In the render method for the link, set the onClick property
  handleClick. Wrap the handler into arrow function so this refers to this object.
</p>

<p>Our counter is ready.</p>
