<h1>Server render</h1>

<p>
  In order to test server rendering in action
  use <a href='/en/boilerplate' class='navigate_link'>ready boilerplate</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next, we will disassemble it:

<h2>Create a server</h2>

<p>/build/server/index.js</p>

{{ create-server }}

<p>
  The server accepts the request, and finds the matched route and controller.
</p>

<a href='/en/createServer' class='navigate_link'>Learn more about creating a server</a>


<h2>Controller</h2>

<p>/build/controllers/WelcomeController.js</p>

{{ controller }}

<p>
  Controller return <b>response code</b>, <b>component name</b> and his <b>properties</b>.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that, the server finds in the folder /build/containers the requested component and
  creates a virtual tree from it. On the basis of this tree, it creates an html string, places it
  in your main template (layout) and sends a request to the browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also, along with the main template in the script#app-cache, the server places the JSON string
  with the data from request.send (). This is done in order to not cause the controller once again
  in the browser.
</p>


<h2>Browser navigation</h2>

<p>/build/index.js</p>

{{ browser-navigation }}

<p>The browser received a response from the server. Now we need to build <b>two virtual trees</b>.</p>


<p><b>1st tree</b> we build on the basis of the DOM that provided us with a browser.</p>

<p><b>2nd tree</b> we build on the basis of JSON controller cache from the script tag mentioned above.</p>

<p>
  Now the render method will compare two trees and restore the difference between them.
  More precisely, hangs the missing events, and it will go all the way through the life cycle
  of the callbacks of each component.
