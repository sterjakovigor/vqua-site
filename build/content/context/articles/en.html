<h1>Context</h1>

<p>
  Sometimes you may need to throw parameters into several components at once.
  For example, you need to provide all of your components with translations.
  And each time to transmit props will be simply tedious.
  Here you will be helped by the context.
</p>

<p>
  To pass the context to the children you need to implement a method <b>passContext</b> in
  the parent component and return the context object.
</p>

<p>
  Also inside the method <b>passContext</b> you can use objects <b>this.props</b> and <b>this.state</b>
</p>

<p>
  And in the component, the expecting context is to implement a static method <b>injectContext</b>
  and return an array of properties of the expected context.
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

{{ app }}
